Explanation of gs://flyem-views
===============================

This bucket contains neuroglancer view settings files, also tracked as a git repo.
They can be used in neuroglancer links, which allows for much shorter links
than one would need if the settings are all specified in the URL itself.

For example:

    https://neuroglancer-demo.appspot.com/#!gs://flyem-views/hemibrain/v1.0/base.json
    https://neuroglancer-demo.appspot.com/#!gs://flyem-views/hemibrain/v1.0/mask-view.json
    https://neuroglancer-demo.appspot.com/#!gs://flyem-views/hemibrain/v1.1/base.json
    https://neuroglancer-demo.appspot.com/#!gs://flyem-views/hemibrain/v1.1/mask-view.json

Note:
    Our hemibrain paper includes some links that use these files.
    Don't delete them!
