Explanation of gs://flyem-views
===============================

This bucket contains neuroglancer view settings files, also tracked as a git repo.
They can be used in neuroglancer links, which allows for much shorter links
than one would need if the settings are all specified in the URL itself.

For example:

    https://hemibrain-dot-neuroglancer-demo.appspot.com/#!gs://flyem-views/hemibrain/v1.0/base.json
    https://hemibrain-dot-neuroglancer-demo.appspot.com/#!gs://flyem-views/hemibrain/v1.0/mask-view.json
    https://hemibrain-dot-neuroglancer-demo.appspot.com/#!gs://flyem-views/hemibrain/v1.1/base.json
    https://hemibrain-dot-neuroglancer-demo.appspot.com/#!gs://flyem-views/hemibrain/v1.1/mask-view.json

Note:
    Our hemibrain paper includes some links that use these files.
    Don't delete them!

Publishing changes
==================

The git repo is just a mirror of the bucket for tracking changes.
After adding/editing files in this repo, publish them by overwriting files in the bucket:

    cd flyem-views
    gsutil  -h 'Cache-Control:public, no-store' cp -r hemibrain gs://flyem-views/

Tip: Set disable caching on all already-uploaded json objects, use `setmeta`:

    gsutil setmeta -h 'Cache-Control:public, no-store' 'gs://flyem-views/**.json'
